This script creates a daily backup of your chosen folder to Google Drive.
It uses 'rclone' to synchronize your files, ensuring that your Google Drive is an exact mirror of your local folder.
Any new files are uploaded, and files that were deleted locally are removed from the backup to keep it up to date.
It is designed to run automatically every night at midnight (00:00).
